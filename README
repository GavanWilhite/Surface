Surface
-------

A few years ago I made a 2D water experiment in Flash, and I really wanted to remake it in WebGL. You should try dragging and dropping your own images onto the surface :)

Additional Credits:
 - Thodoris Tsiridis (the default, and amazing, photo)
 - Mr. doob & AlteredQualia, Three.js
 - Paul Irish, Modernizr and rAF shim

As always these libs, etc are included for convenience but I encourage you to look at the original projects.
